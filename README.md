# mafia-roller
Mafia roller bot in kotlin

Bot for t.me/truemafiabot

# Usage
1. Clone project via IntelliJ Idea; create file configSource.kt near to config.kt and fill necessary data from api and chat id
2. Run com.y9san9.mafiaboost.Auth.kt and authorize with 4 accounts
2. Run com.y9san9.mafiaboost.Main.kt (bots will try to roll in the chat from CHAT_ID variable, be sure that all accounts are there)

## Easy way
There is no easy way right now, but if there will be 10 stars, I'll create executable jar file for program that will be easy to run
